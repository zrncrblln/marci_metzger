Goal:
Create a pixel-accurate "Featured Properties" section inspired by a modern real estate website template.
The output must replicate a professional real estate featured listing layout with property cards,
clean grid alignment, modern typography, and production-level responsive design.

STRICT RULE:
DO NOT redesign or reinterpret the layout.
DO NOT invent new UI patterns.
ONLY replicate a professional real estate "Featured Section" structure and styling.

SECTION STRUCTURE:

1. Section Container
   - Centered max-width container (1200px–1320px)
   - Horizontal padding (16px–24px)
   - Vertical spacing top/bottom (64px–96px)
   - Background: light neutral or white
   - Clean modern spacing similar to premium real estate templates

2. Header Area
   - Small subtitle text (e.g., "Featured Properties")
   - Large bold headline (32px–42px)
   - Optional short description paragraph
   - Left aligned or centered depending on layout
   - Clear visual hierarchy
   - Margin bottom ~40px–56px

3. Grid Layout
   - Desktop: 3 columns
   - Tablet: 2 columns
   - Mobile: 1 column
   - Equal spacing gap (20px–30px)
   - Perfect vertical alignment
   - Consistent card height

4. Property Card Design
   Each card must include:
   - Image container with aspect ratio (16:9 or 4:3)
   - Property label badge (Featured / For Sale / For Rent)
   - Price overlay or price section
   - Title (Property name or address)
   - Location text with icon
   - Property details row:
     • Bedrooms
     • Bathrooms
     • Area (sqm/ft²)
   - Divider line
   - Agent/avatar section or CTA button
   - Hover effect:
     • slight elevation
     • subtle shadow increase
     • smooth transition (0.2s–0.3s)

5. Visual Styling
   - Rounded corners (12px–16px)
   - Soft modern shadows
   - Neutral modern color palette
   - Clean sans-serif typography
   - Balanced whitespace
   - Professional spacing scale

6. Responsive Behavior
   - Fluid image resizing
   - No layout shift
   - Grid collapses properly
   - Text truncation if too long
   - Mobile-first design

7. Accessibility
   - Semantic HTML
   - Proper alt tags
   - ARIA labels where needed
   - Keyboard focus states

8. Code Requirements
   - Clean modular component structure
   - Reusable card component
   - No inline messy styling
   - Maintainable class naming
   - Production-ready code

9. Output Must Include
   - Full section component
   - Property card component
   - Styling (CSS/Tailwind/SCSS depending on project)
   - Example property JSON data (5–6 sample listings)
   - Responsive layout logic

10. Technical Constraints

- Follow existing project design tokens
- Maintain current spacing system
- Match existing UI components if present
- No external UI frameworks unless already used

11. Animation Behavior

- Smooth hover transitions
- Optional subtle image zoom on hover
- No heavy animations

IMPORTANT:
The final result must visually match a professional real estate "Featured Properties"
section used in premium templates — modern, clean, and structured.
Focus on layout accuracy, spacing precision, and UI consistency.
